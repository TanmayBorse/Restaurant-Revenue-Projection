# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Revenue Prediction

Welcome to the **Restaurant Revenue Prediction** project! This project aims to predict restaurant revenue based on multiple factors such as location, type, and other demographic, real estate, and commercial data. The insights from this prediction can assist businesses in making more informed decisions about site selection for new restaurant locations.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

We are working with two datasets:
- **Training Dataset (train.csv)**: Contains data for 137 restaurants.
- **Test Dataset**: Includes 100,000 restaurant entries for prediction (without revenue information).
